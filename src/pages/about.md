Welcome to my website.

I'm a long time professional developer that recently started watching people stream their software development processes on twitch. It looked like a lot of fun and I've taken the plunge to try it out myself.
After realizing that having a webcam pointed at my face all the time just wasn't for me, I decided to try out streaming as a vtuber.

Looking around at the different ways people have created an avatar for their on-stream persona, I thought I'd try something a little easier to learn (and less expensive), so I made my own custom 2D avatar using Inkscape and Unity.

With my experience using both of these in my spare time it didn't take long at all to get this weasel up and running and ready to stream.

I hope you can join me as I teach what I know, and learn what I don't.

See you online!
